Dear Doge Familia,

This is the Dogefather. The father of all coins. I have spent my entire life as the head of the doge family and I was called upon today to introduce myself to the crypto currency world. Just when I think I’m out, they pull me back in. I’m going to make a coin they can’t refuse.

We’re a fork of Dogecoin, but that won’t stop us from enjoying our cannoli. The name, The Dogefather, comes from being the patriarch, and it’s time a father spends time with his family. This is your time to take sides with the family, and to never think about taking sides with anyone against the family. Ever.

Our aspirations are high, and our bond even stronger. The Dogefather always takes care of his kids, and there will be no rug pulls here. We don’t believe in lies, only a strong family. We want to build this family as large as possible so don’t break my heart.
